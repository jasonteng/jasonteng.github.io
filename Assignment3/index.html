    <h2><strong>Ecologists discover when and how tropical trees 
    regenerate</strong> </h2>
    <p>Nouabale-Ndoki National Park is a tree-dotted enclave in the Republic of 
    Congo. Heavy logging surrounds the park, but it still has one of the largest 
    intact forests in Africa. In recognition, it recently became a UNESCO World 
    Heritage Site.</p>
    <p>Thousands of trees make up a forest. How did the trees in Nouabale-Ndoki 
    become so numerous, and how do they stay that way?</p>
    <p>The answer, say biologists, lies far below the tree canopy, in the soil where
    seedlings sprout.</p>
    <p>The project is spearheaded by the Fred. S. Burroughs Chapter of Trout 
    Unlimited, which is planning for a spring community ceremony celebrating the 
    work.</p>
    <p>The group had originally obtained grants for a different stretch of river, 
    but when that plan fell apart, the group's attention was directed toward the 
    glen. Approval was given for the grant money to be used in the township-owned 
    park.</p>
    <p>In addition to replanting the ravine's walls, the goal was to re-create the 
    stream bed and natural flood plain. In April, a large earth-moving machine was 
    brought in and reshaped the stream with pools, natural riffles and rapids, and 
    ways for high water to dissipate its energy, rather than dig away at the river 
    banks.</p>
    <p>Cowden manned one of the five stations, talking about water flows, stream 
    beds and the life, both in the water and along the banks, that is 
    regenerating.</p>
